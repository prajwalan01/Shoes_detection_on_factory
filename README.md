Shoes Detection in Factory
Description
This project uses YOLOv8-based object detection to monitor factory workers' safety by detecting whether individuals are wearing shoes in a specified Region of Interest (ROI) within video frames. It displays warnings for non-compliance and saves the annotated output video.

Features
Detects person and shoes within a defined ROI.
Shows bounding boxes around detected objects.
Displays warning ("Person without shoes!") when non-compliance is detected.
Saves the annotated video (output_video.mp4) for further analysis.
Logs non-compliance events in the console.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
